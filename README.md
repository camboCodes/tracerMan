In lines of code and midnight dreams,
We forged our vision, thread by thread.
Each keystroke, every silent scream,
Built hope from sweat and tears we shed.

Through trials deep and bugs that taunted,
Our passion burned in every line.
In every challenge, truth enchantedâ€”
A testament to dreams divine.

Let this project stand as proof,
That heart and grit can light the way.
In every flaw, a shining truth,
Our labor turns night into day.
